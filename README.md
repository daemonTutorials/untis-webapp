# untis-webapp
This WebApp is currently available in german language for students of the BBS Lingen in Germany, Lower Saxony. 
A running version can be accessed at [my school Dev-Server](http://mwserver.bplaced.net/tug-vertretungen).

At the moment it depends on a php-file that is a workaround to bypass the missing CORS-Header of the school server.
